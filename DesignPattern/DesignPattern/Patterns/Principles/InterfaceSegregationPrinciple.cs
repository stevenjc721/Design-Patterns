/*
 * Interface Segregation Principle: states that no client should be forced to depend on methods it does not use. 
 * ISP splits interfaces that are very large into smaller and more specific ones so that clients will only have to know about the 
 * methods that are of interest to them. Shrunken interfaces are called role interfaces. ISP is intended to keep a system decoupled 
 * and thus easier to refactor, change, and redeploy.
